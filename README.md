# Beer Hero

Beer Hero is a [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) application designed to provide beer recommendations
via an intuitive to use app for Android and IOS.

## Project Goal
The objective of the project is to provide a simple application that can recommend different types of beers to people. 
It should be a simple app that is aimed towards anyone who enjoys drinking beer, 
and trying different kinds/brands. 

The app will be able to save what beers someone says they liked, 
and if they dislike a beer it will narrow down the recommendations.
